## Data Source
Horoscope readings are sourced via [Horoscope-API](https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/Horoscope-API), which in turn scrapes data from [horoscope.com](https://www.horoscope.com).  
- We don’t generate or interpret horoscopes ourselves.  
- This integration simply provides a clean and convenient way to fetch and display them in WindowSill.
